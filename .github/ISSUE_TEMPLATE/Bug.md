Provide a failing Unit or Functional Test - you can submit one in a Pull
Request separately, referencing this bug report. And if you feel like it, why
not fix the bug while you're at it?

application that reproduces the bug.
If the bug is simple, you may provide a code snippet instead, or even a list of
steps.
